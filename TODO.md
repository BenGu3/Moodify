Current State:

  No style.
  Gets each track in first few albums by input artist.
  Adds tracks above .65 valence to Spotify playlist to my Spotify account.
  


Problems:
  
  Too many songs per request sometimes.
  Refreshing token through authorization.
  Get from related artists.
  What to do if there are no "happy" songs.
  Backend
    Possibly using Spotify itself as the backend.
    I could pull the playlist from Spotify that was already created when a station is clicked.
    Save the names of the playlists with MongoDB or Firebase.
