Current State:

  Auth added and functional.
  No style.
  Gets each track in first few albums by input artist.
  Adds tracks above .65 valence to Spotify playlist to my Spotify account.
  


Problems:
  
  Do something until logged in.
  Too many songs per request sometimes.
  Do I need to refresh the auth token?
  Get from related artists.
  What to do if there are no "happy" songs.
  Backend
    Possibly using Spotify itself as the backend.
    I could pull the playlist from Spotify that was already created when a station is clicked.
    Save the names of the playlists with MongoDB or Firebase.
