# Moodify

Application idea. 
Uses Spotify API to retrieve valence of tracks and then returns a randomized playlist of a specific mood.

(Possible play around with other audio features)

# NEW IDEA

Goal:

  A web "happy" radio app.
  Spotify authentication.
  List of your stations by artist.
  Station gets random song from artist or related artists.
    Plays only "happy" songs from each artist based on VALENCE.
